# Group-Project
Test repo for Final Projects, created October 26, 2021

- Craft Breweries
- We choose this topic because it is important that everyone has access to craft beer
- Our Data comes from multiple datasets
  - Our 1st set of data contains a list of all the breweries in the United States along with their location
  - Our 2nd set of data contains Unemployment data by county from 2000 to 2019
  - Our 3rd set of data contains Educational data by county, showing the level of education completed
    -The levels of Education in our data set are 
      -No Diploma, High School Diploma, Some College, 4 Year College 

-We are seeking to predict how many breweries you will find in a county and identify some counties that would be a good place to open a brewery because they have less than the average we discovered.

## Communication Protocol 
- Our team is utilizing our slack channel to ensure we are working together to complete all steps
- We also assigned team member roles using the play station button method, this will help us hold each other accountable for what we are trying to do.
  - Clayton is the Square Role, meaning he is responsible for the repository. 
  - Eric is the Triangle Role, he is responsible for creating a mockup of a machine learning model.
  - Lisa is the Circle Role, she is responsible for creating the database.
  - John is the X Role, he will decide which technologies to use for each step in the project.
