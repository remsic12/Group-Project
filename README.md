# Group-Project
Test repo for Final Projects, created October 26, 2021

- Craft Breweries
- We choose this topic because it is important that everyone has access to craft beer
- Our Data comes from multiple datasets
  - Our 1st set of data contains a list of all the breweries in the United States along with their location
  - Our 2nd set of data contains Unemployment data by county from 2000 to 2019, as well as median household income for 2019
  - Our 3rd set of data contains Educational data by county, showing the level of education completed
    -The levels of Education in our data set are 
      -No Diploma, High School Diploma, Some College, 4 Year College 

## Project Objective 
-We are seeking to identify counties with low unemployment and high median household incomes and display in a map. We then want to take this data to make reccomendations to potential craft brewers on where they should open a craft brewery.

## Communication Protocol 
- Our team is utilizing our slack channel to ensure we are working together to complete all steps
- We are having a stand up meeting set daily
  - Monday through Friday we will meet at 6pm
  - Saturday and Sunday we will meet at 10am 
- We also assigned team member roles using the play station button method, this will help us hold each other accountable for what we are trying to do.
  - Clayton is the Square Role, meaning he is responsible for the repository. 
  - Eric is the Triangle Role, he is responsible for creating a mockup of a machine learning model.
  - Lisa is the Circle Role, she is responsible for creating the database.
  - John is the X Role, he will decide which technologies to use for each step in the project.
